# Experiment 3 - Graph Traversal using DFS and BFS

This experiment demonstrates **graph traversal techniques** using Python:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

The graph is implemented using an **adjacency list**, and both traversal methods are printed starting from node `'A'`.

## üîß Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Uses only built-in modules (`collections`)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python graph_traversal.py
